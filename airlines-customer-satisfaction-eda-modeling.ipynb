Remarkably, those who give a rating of 5 are almost exclusively satisfied, indicating an absence of dissatisfied customers in this category. Conversely, those rating 1, 2, or 3 are generally dissatisfied, highlighting that customer ratings for 'Inflight entertainment' distinctly reflect their satisfaction.\n\nSimilarly, when examining 'Seat comfort,' 'Online support,' 'Ease of Online booking,' 'On-board service,', 'Leg room service,' and 'Online boarding' we notice that most customers who provide ratings of 4 or 5 express satisfaction, unlike lower ratings. This suggests that these factors are pivotal in determining customer satisfaction.\n\nConversely, 'Departure/Arrival time convenient' and 'Gate location' do not exhibit a clear pattern in their ratings, as customers giving ratings of \"4\" 50% of them are satisfied and 50% are not satisfied.

Highlight Inflight Entertainment as a Feature: In marketing and service promotions, emphasize the availability and quality of Inflight entertainment, especially in 'Business' class, to attract and retain customers who value this feature.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Plotting histograms 'Inflight entertainment' ratings by different Customer Type\nsns.histplot(df[df['Customer Type'] == 'Loyal Customer']['Inflight entertainment'], label='Loyal Customer', kde=True)\nsns.histplot(df[df['Customer Type'] == 'disloyal Customer']['Inflight entertainment'], label='disloyal Customer', kde=True)\n\n# Setting the x-axis label, y-axis label, plot title, and adding a legend\nplt.xlabel('Inflight entertainment Rating')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.title('Distribution of Inflight Entertainment Rating by Type of Travel')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Displaying the plot\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-26T11:04:36.915145Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-26T11:04:36.915502Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-26T11:04:38.180026Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-26T11:04:36.915470Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-26T11:04:38.178814Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This graph also underscores the significance of 'Inflight Entertainment' in shaping customer satisfaction levels.

Consequently, it becomes apparent that focusing on inflight entertainment, particularly for customers within this age group, could be instrumental. By providing an array of compelling and diverse entertainment options, airlines can enhance the satisfaction levels of these customers and attract a broader audience within this age range.\n\nIn summary, this insight underscores the importance of catering to the entertainment preferences of customers in the 20 to 40 age group, who are more likely to be disloyal, by offering appealing entertainment choices.

The \"Inflight Entertainment\" feature, in particular, has shown substantial influence. \n\nImportantly, we discovered that age also influences satisfaction, with older passengers typically expressing higher satisfaction levels.\n\nIn our predictive modeling, the Random Forest algorithm yielded outstanding results, achieving an accuracy of 95%. This algorithm, along with feature importance analysis, confirmed the pivotal role of \"Inflight Entertainment\" and \"Seat Comfort\" in shaping customer satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis equips Invistico Airlines with insights to prioritize areas for improvement, specifically enhancing Inflight Entertainment and seat comfort. By addressing these aspects, the airline can foster higher customer satisfaction, bolster customer loyalty, and elevate its overall service quality.","metadata":{}}]}
